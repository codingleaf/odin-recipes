Project: Recipes

This small project is part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.

The goal of this project is to hone my personal skills in HTML providing a solid foundation that will help me through my journey in the world of web development.

This is a simple website containing different food recipes showing their ingredients and the steps required to make them.
